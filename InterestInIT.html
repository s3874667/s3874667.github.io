    <p id="bodyStyle">
    Since my youth, I have always been interested in the intricacy and details behind
    computers and how they operate. The mysteries behind how computers were able to
    interact and communicate with each other, the concept of Wireless internet and
    various software and programs that made our daily lives easier had fascinated
    me, which all contributed to my growing passion to one day be able to learn
    about and create my own programs to benefit society.<br><br>
    Out of all the different universities that fell within my current qualifications,
    RMIT stood out as it best represented a place where I can establish an identity,
    develop my abilities and achieve the skills and knowledge required to enter the
    IT industry.<br><br>
    As I progress through my course, I hope to learn the details behind the operation
    of computers, the various programming languages used in the development of the
    programs and software that make our lives easier, the ability to create and
    manage my own websites and servers, understand the importance of collaborations
    and teamwork during projects. Ultimately, being able to graduate with the skills
    and qualifications needed to enter the workforce.
