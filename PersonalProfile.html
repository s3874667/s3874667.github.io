    <h3 id="subHeading"> The results of the test:</h3><br>
    <p id="bodyStyle">
    The 16 personalities Myer Briggs online test determined my personality
    to be that of an entertainer (ESFP-T), and the DISC assessment test which tests individuals
    over the traits (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and Conscientiousness), concluded myself
    to be of the category Steadiness.<br><br>

    The above tests describe me to be an extraverted individual, who makes emotion driven decisions
    over logical thinking, and takes a prospective approach to their work. They also describe me
    to be a supportive and reliable individual, however with the risk to lose sight of the
    objective at hand.
    The results were close to home as they were to an extent an accurate representation
    of my character, which allowed me to better understand my strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>

    However the learning styles test conducted determined me to be an Auditory/tactile learner,
    These results donâ€™t seem in line with my learning habits, as while I consider myself
    to be a tactile learner, I tend to learn better visually through text and images
    over listening to information.</p>

    <h3 id="subHeading">How would the results influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
    <p id="bodyStyle">
    The results of these tests were able to make me aware of and acknowledge my various traits,
    this may lead me to have more confidence in my own abilities when working in a team environment,
    and allow me to work towards my full potential.<br></p>

    <h3 id="subHeading">How should I take these results into account when forming a team?</h3>
    <p id="bodyStyle">
    Based on the outcome of these results, it is important for me to find team members
    with supportive traits and are able to synergize easily with me.
    It is also vital, to ensure that my team includes members who consist of the traits
    that I lack in, in order to help me avoid making mistakes and provide support
    when faced with challenging tasks and various important decisions.</p>
