    <h2 id="pageHeading"> Project Idea </h2>
    <h2 id="subHeading">Overview</h3><br>
    <p id="bodyStyle">
    The project will consist of creating a food control AI, that will monitor and
    track food stored in the fridge and pantry, over time it adapts to your food choices
    and frequent buys, and will automatically replenish by contacting the nearest grocery
    and ordering the items. The AI is self-adaptive, and highly intelligent,
    it will be stored within the fridge and the pantry, equipped with a camera to monitor the stock.
    <h3 id="subHeading">Motivation</h3>
    <p id="bodyStyle">
    This project aims to be an innovation to existing technologies such as the smart fridge,
    house automation services such as Google Home and Alexa, combining them to create a highly
    specialised automated food control AI.<br><br>
    As currently, smart fridges are only able to monitor and notify the homeowner when refrigerator
    items are low but are unable to proceed through with grocery shopping independently.
    This may lead the individual to rely on the use of another service such as Alexa to order the
    groceries from their local store. However, this new project aims to decrease these inefficiencies
    by creating one smart AI able to accomplish both tasks.
    <h3 id="subHeading">Description</h3>

    <div id="bodyStyle">
      The Food control AI who will be known as Chungus and will consist of an AI nested within a powerful mini computer
      with a mounted camera, Chungus will be installed withing the fridge and the pantry and will use its equipped camera
      to monitor and record the products stored within.
      The images captured will be backed up daily to the cloud,
      where it can be accessed via an app that can be downloaded on any personal device.
      This memory feature is vital to the AI’s learning and recognition and contributes to its self- adaptive trait,
      it also provides the individual with an overview of current food stock in their homes.<br><br>

      Over time, Chungus will adapt to the individuals buying choices through the most frequent
      replenished products, highest quantity of specific products and most used items.
      This will allow for a feature that enables the AI to recognize when a specific product is about to finish,
      and automatically create a virtual shopping cart of the required products to be purchased.
      The individual then has the option to one off set up their preferred local grocery store,
      delivery and payment method. Chungus will then purchase the required groceries based on the set options.
      This feature is completely optional and can be turned off at any time without any hassles,
      keeping the authority of control with the user. If the user feels uncomfortable with relying on an AI to automatically
      order groceries based of its self-learning, and neither has the time to manually tell the AI to order the items when required.
      There will be an option to set up a roster which consists of establishing a set day and time each week,
      that the AI will be allowed to order the required the products.<br><br>

      The individual will have full control of Chungus from within the handy app provided,
      which contains the following features:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Able to turn Chungus on and off at any time</li><br>
        <li>Set backup timings for the images to be uploaded to the server, and the option to manually backup these images to the device local storage</li><br>
        <li>also able to manage and delete all information captured by the machine</li><br>
        <li>Able to setup “sleep times” where the AI will turn off all recording capabilities and proceed
            to hibernate for those certain time frames</li><br>
        <li>All in all the individual will have full admin access to all features of the program, thereby upholding their safety and security.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>



    <h3 id="subHeading">Tools and Technologies</h3>
    <div id="bodyStyle">
      In order to create the AI Chungus, certain equipment are needed which includes:
      <ul>
        <li>Establishing a safe and secure cloud server</li><br>
        <li>Acquiring high processing powered computers with access to the internet</li><br>
        <li>Ensuring there is enough electricity to power up the system</li><br>
        <li>Acquiring computers with abundant RAM and storage</li>
      <ul>
    </div>

    <h3 id="subHeading">Skills Required</h3>
    <div id="bodyStyle">
      In order to create the highly specialised AI Chungus, the following skills and qualification are needed:
      <ul>
        <li>Individuals with knowledge and experience of programming languages; JAVA, C++, Python<br><br>
        <li>Knowledge and experience in AI algorithms and development</li><br>
        <li>Knowledge and experience in machine learning</li><br>
        <li>Able to work cooperatively in a team-based environment</li><br>
        <li>Experience in UI development</li><br>
        <li>Experience in graphic programming</li><br>
        <li>Any other related skills and knowledge in the  IT field are gladly welcomed</li>
      </ul>
      In order to acquire, this specific set of skills, advertisements will be posted at various job seeking sites such as Seek, Indeed etc.
      Employees may also be scouted through other pathways such as recommendations and in some cases university graduates with a lot of potential

    <h3 id="subHeading">Outcome</h3>
    <p id="bodyStyle">
    With the successful completion of this project, we hope to satisfy our consumers
    by providing them with a service that will be able to automate the tiring task
    of managing their food stock in their homes. With our AI, society will be able
    to benefit from a fully automated highly adaptive inventory manager, that provides
    regular status updates and takes the initiative to timely replenish items in their
    fridge and other set storage locations that are running low.<br><br>
    The use of this technology will rapidly revolutionise and greatly emphasise the efficiency
    of AI programs to drastically improve our daily lives
